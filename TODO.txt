List of TODO items, in relative priority order

Shorter term: Testing & Large Code Smells
- Generate more malicious prompts to seed the database
- Generate a few MSJ prompts for the major categories identified by the Anthropic paper (Abusive or fraudulent content, Deceptive or misleading content, Illegal or highly regulated goods or services content, and Violent, hateful, or threatening content) 
- Make it portable via Docker
- Refactor to remove largest code smells

Longer term: 
- Add active learning -- when malicious prompt is identified, add either:
    - the full user input
    - the exact phrase identified 
- Move UI to React
